When creating users, you can choose between creating AI users, that is, AI agents that you will be able to use in your automations, or human agents, who will be able to access the platform, interact with it and assist users from the livechat section.

## Creating human agents

Inviting users and agents is very simple, as you only have to enter the email of the person you want to give access to, and they will receive an email to access and configure their account. When making the invitation, you can provide that user with access such as:

## Agent configuration

To finish configuring the agent or user profile, you must enter personal data and some information that will influence the Livechat auto-assignment logic if it is activated. These data are:

* **Group name**: You can select the group to which the agent or user has access. This way, they will only be able to view conversations related to that group in the Livechat. Groups can be configured in the departments and tags section within settings.

* **Maximum chats**: This is the maximum chat assignment capacity that an agent has. Therefore, if the agent reaches the maximum number of chats, another chat will not be assigned until a previously assigned chat is finished.

* **Closing margin minutes**:

* **Languages**: The agent will only be able to take chats that are in those specific languages.
