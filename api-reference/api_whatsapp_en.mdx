## Intro

This manual describes in a practical way the methodology for connecting and accessing Lovi API services, allowing the sending of notifications via WhatsApp. Authentication is performed using tokens that enable basic authentication for the API services.

## 🔑 Authentication

To access any Lovi API endpoint, you first need to authenticate by sending a POST request to the authentication endpoint with your email and password. In response, you'll receive a personal access token.

**Token Rotation**: We recommend periodically rotating tokens and storing them securely.


### Authentication Endpoint

To obtain your access token, send a POST request to the following URL:

```
POST https://cloud.lovi.ai/auth/v1/token?grant_type=password
```

### Headers

You need to include the following header in your request to indicate that the content you're sending is in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
```

### Body
In the body of your request, securely send your email and password in JSON format:

```json
{
  "email": "your-email@example.com",
  "password": "your-secure-password"
}
```

### Response

If the request is successful, you'll receive a response containing your access token. You'll use this token to interact with the other API endpoints.

```json
{
  "access_token": "your-personal-access-token",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600
}

```

> 📌 Important: Save this token — you'll use it to interact with the rest of the API.
