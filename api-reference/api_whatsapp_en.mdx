## Intro

This manual describes in a practical way the methodology for connecting and accessing Lovi API services, allowing the sending of notifications via WhatsApp. Authentication is performed using tokens that enable basic authentication for the API services.

## 🔑 Authentication

To access any Lovi API endpoint, you first need to authenticate by sending a POST request to the authentication endpoint with your email and password. In response, you'll receive a personal access token.

**Token Rotation**: We recommend periodically rotating tokens and storing them securely.


### Authentication Endpoint

To obtain your access token, send a POST request to the following URL:

```
POST https://cloud.lovi.ai/auth/v1/token?grant_type=password
```

### Headers

You need to include the following header in your request to indicate that the content you're sending is in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
```

### Body
In the body of your request, securely send your email and password in JSON format:

```json
{
  "email": "your-email@example.com",
  "password": "your-secure-password"
}
```

### Response

If the request is successful, you'll receive a response containing your access token. You'll use this token to interact with the other API endpoints.

```json
{
  "access_token": "your-personal-access-token",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600
}

```

> 📌 Important: Save this token — you'll use it to interact with the rest of the API.

## 🧭 Retrieve Company API Keys

After obtaining your token, the next step is to retrieve the list of API keys for the companies your user has access to.

### Endpoint

The request to retrieve the API keys is also a **POST** request:

```
POST https://cloud.lovi.ai/functions/v1/api_keys
```

### Headers

You need to include the **access token** in the request headers like this:

```json
{
  "Authorization": "Bearer your-personal-access-token"
}
```

### Response

The response will contain a list of API keys for the companies your user has access to, along with their respective company IDs:

```json
[
  {
    "company_id": "example-company-id",
    "access_key": "example-access-key"
  }
]
```

> 📝 Each company will have a unique access key. You must use the correct key depending on which company you're interacting with.

---

### 🔁 Token per Company

Once you identify which company you want to work with, you must authenticate again to generate a **company-level token**. This is usually required for secured actions like sending notifications or uploading media.

You will use the previously retrieved `access_key` in your query parameters or headers, depending on the endpoint.

---

## 📣 Send Notification

To send a notification using the Lovi API, you need to make a POST request to the appropriate endpoint with the necessary headers and body content. The notification request will include information such as the recipient's details, the content of the notification, and the campaign associated with it. Below is a detailed explanation of how to structure the request.

### Endpoint

To send a notification, you'll need to send a POST request to the following endpoint. The `access_key` and `unflatten`parameters are included in the URL:

```
POST https://cloud.lovi.ai/functions/v1/notify?access_key=your-access-key&unflatten=true
```

### Headers

You’ll need to include the API key in the request headers for authorization:

```json
{
  "apikey": "your-api-key"
}
```

### Body

In the body of the request, you’ll send the notification details, including placeholders for dynamic data (such as {{name}}). Here's an example:

```json
{
  "components_push.body_text_0": "{{name}}",
  "components_push.body_text_1": "Technical in Nursing Care Assistance",
  "contact.number": "34666033135",
  "contact.name": "User name",
  "language_template": "en_US",
  "name_template": "campaignID",
  "recipient_id": "1234",
  "notification_type": "marketing",
  "campaign_name": "Example Campaign"
}
```
* **components_push.body_text_0**: This is where the recipient’s name or other dynamic data will be inserted.

* **components_push.body_text_1**: A predefined text that will be included in the notification.

* **contact.number**: The recipient's phone number.

* **contact.name**: The recipient's name.

* **language_template**: Specifies the language of the template. For Spanish, you would set the language_template to `es_ES`.

* **name_template**: Contains the name of the approved template for WhatsApp.

* **recipient_id**: A unique identifier for the recipient.

* **notification_type**: The type of notification being sent, such as "marketing" in this case.

* **campaign_name**: The name of the campaign to which the notification belongs.

## 📚 Tips for Development

Here are some helpful tips for working with the Lovi API:

- Use `access_key` when available in query parameters.
- Use `apikey` or `Authorization: Bearer` in headers depending on endpoint security.
- For endpoints that deal with voice or widgets, `session_id` is crucial.
- Store and handle tokens securely.

---

## ✅ Status and Monitoring

For checking the status and monitoring the system, you can use the following endpoints:

- `GET /functions/v1/web/status_chat` → Check chat status
- `GET /functions/v1/widget` → Get web widget configuration
