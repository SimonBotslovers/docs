# Official documentation for extracting raw data from the database

This document aims to provide access and a description of the main data structures available to the company to facilitate proper integration, management, and analysis of information related to interactions and participating agents.

In addition to describing each table structure, it includes recommendations and warnings regarding the responsible handling of personal data that may be found in the records, highlighting the importance of complying with current privacy and information security regulations.

We suggest carefully reviewing each field definition and the notes on handling personal data before starting any integration or analysis process to ensure the safe and proper use of the provided database.

<Warning>
  The data presented is raw and unprocessed.

## Accessing the Data in ClickHouse via HTTP and BI Tools

This section explains how to connect to the Botslovers ClickHouse database, either through direct HTTP access (for example using `curl`) or via graphical tools and Business Intelligence tools like DBeaver, Power BI, or Tableau.

### Access via HTTP (example using curl)

You can access the data by executing SQL queries directly against the ClickHouse database via its HTTP interface.

**Basic Example:**

To retrieve the first 10 records from the `messages_<company>` table:

```bash
curl -u user:'password' 'https://public-clickhouse.botslovers.com/?query=SELECT%20*%20FROM%20messages_company%20LIMIT%2010'
```

Replace `user` and `password` with your personal credentials.

<Note>
  The `query` parameter must be URL-encoded.
</Note>

**Response Formats:**

By default, the response is in TabSeparated format. You can request other formats by adding `FORMAT` at the end of the query:

**JSON Example:**

```bash
curl -u user:'password' "https://public-clickhouse.botslovers.com/?query=SELECT%20*%20FROM%20messages_company%20LIMIT%2010%20FORMAT%20JSON"
```

**CSV Example:**

```bash
curl -u user:'password' "https://public-clickhouse.botslovers.com/?query=SELECT%20*%20FROM%20messages_company%20LIMIT%2010%20FORMAT%20CSV"
```

### Access from BI Tools or Database Clients (DBeaver, Power BI, Tableau, etc.)

ClickHouse supports JDBC and ODBC connectors, allowing you to use graphical tools to explore and analyze the data.

#### Access via DBeaver

- Open DBeaver and create a new connection.
- Select ClickHouse as the database type.
- Choose HTTP as the connection type.
- Fill in the following fields:
  - Host: `public-clickhouse.botslovers.com`
  - Port: `443`
  - User: your username
  - Password: your password
  - SSL: enabled (make sure the box is checked)
- Test the connection and save.

#### Access from BI Tools (Power BI, Tableau, etc.)

**Power BI**

- Download and install the official ClickHouse ODBC driver.
- Configure an ODBC DSN pointing to:
  - Host: `public-clickhouse.botslovers.com`
  - Port: `443` (or `8443` depending on configuration, check with your administrator)
  - SSL Mode: enabled
  - Username/Password: your credentials
- In Power BI, create a new ODBC data source and select the configured DSN.

**Tableau**

- You can use the ClickHouse ODBC driver as in Power BI.
- Alternatively, use the native ClickHouse connector.

## Security and Best Practices

- Your credentials are personal and must not be shared.
- Consult your administrator if you have questions about usage limits or data structure.
- We recommend avoiding queries that extract large volumes of data to prevent potential service performance issues.

## Tables

### `messages`

Acts as the central repository where each individual message generated in a conversation is stored. This document details its fields, purpose, and specific recommendations for managing sensitive data securely.

### `agent_activity`

Tables that concentrate relevant information about agents — human or automated — participating in conversations. They facilitate associating events and metrics to each agent for individual activity analysis, key indicator calculations (e.g., response times, session closures, agent availability), and action traceability across conversations, even when transfers occur.

## Table Descriptions

### `messages` (Table: `messages_<company>`)

## Handling of Personal Data

The `messages_`table, especially the `text` column, retains the full content of customer interactions, potentially containing personal data such as names, email addresses, ID numbers, or other details about the products or services offered by your company.

<Warning>
  These records have not been anonymized or pseudonymized to preserve the full context of each conversation and ensure analysis accuracy.
</Warning>

It is **essential** to process this data according to applicable regulations, always maintaining confidentiality, security, and the rights of data subjects.
