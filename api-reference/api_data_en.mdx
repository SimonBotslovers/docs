## Tables

### `messages`

This table acts as the central repository for all individual messages generated within a conversation. Below are its fields, purpose, and specific recommendations for managing sensitive data securely.

### `agent_activity`

This table contains relevant information about agents — both human and automated — participating in conversations. It enables associating events and metrics with each agent, helping in:

- Individual activity analysis
- Calculation of key indicators (e.g., response times, session durations, agent availability)
- Traceability of actions, even across agent transfers

### `agent_activity`

> ⚠️ No data has been incorporated yet.

This table is planned to store event data linked to both human and virtual agents to support session tracking and individual performance analysis.

## Handling of Personal Data

The materialized view `messages_mv`, particularly the `text` column, retains the full content of customer interactions. This may include personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, email addresses, ID numbers, booking codes, and travel details.

> ⚠️ These records have not been anonymized or pseudonymized to preserve conversation context and ensure analytical accuracy.

It is **essential** to process this data in accordance with applicable regulations, ensuring confidentiality, data security, and respect for the rights of data subjects.
