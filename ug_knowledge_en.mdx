## Introduction to Knowledge base

You probably have numerous sources of valuable information for your users, such as your website, PDFs, or FAQs, among others. This section will allow you to connect or upload all your data sources so that your AI agent can respond accurately. To do this, you  have several options:

* FAQs: You can create your FAQs with an easy-to-use interface. Just create your question, assign it a category, and create an answer in the format of your choice. FAQs are a great way to make things easy for your AI agent, as the content is structured and optimized.

* Crawler: Here you will be able to download all the content of your web domain, so that it will learn everything about it. It is the easiest way to maintain your AI agent, since you do not have to maintain the content. In addition, once the crawler finishes, you will be able to see all your URLs in an orderly manner and deactivate those that you do not want it to respond to. To make everything much easier for you, the crawler updates all the content every 24 hours so that your information is always up-to-date.

* Files: Upload all documents to complete your knowledge base. This includes PDFs, word pages, excel pages, and .txt files. Please note that image content is not currently recognized, so make sure that as much of the content as possible is in text format...
